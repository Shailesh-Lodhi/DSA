*******************HISTORY OF JAVA*********************

Java is built by green team at sunmicrosystem by james gosling. In that time the goal of java creation is for 
set-top boxes and for television.
James gosling wanted to make a programming language for televisions but due to passes of time james goasling 
want to connect their language to the internet . So they work hard on it and make java capable for run on
 internet or world wide web. In 1995 James Gosling release java.

NAMING OF JAVA ->

Firstly it is called GREENTALK by James Gosling and the file extension was .gt . After that it was publicly
 called OAK. (OAK is a symbol of strength and also it is a national tree of USA, Germany, France, Romania).
In 1995 OAK was renamed by java because it was already trade mark of OAK technologies.
Java is an island in indonasia where the first coffee was produced named java.
Java name was chosen by James Gosling while having a cup of coffee near by his office.

WHY JAVA IS USED FOR APPLICATIONS ->

Java is a simple, portable, secure, platform independence, robustness, object orientation, high performance ,
multithreded. These features make java to make a wide range of applications.
These features helps java to switch television language to the run on internet or browser.Now java is used for 
window applications, mobile applications, web applications, enterprise applications, cards.


            ************************DIFFERENCE BTW C++ AND JAVA*******************************

1. Java is platform independent while c++ is platform dependent.
2. C++ is mainly used for system programming and java is mainly used for applications like windows, enterprise,
   mobile and web applications.
3. C++ supports GOTO statement but Java doesn't supports GOTO statement.
4. C++ supports multiple inheritance but Java doesn't supports multiple inheritance through a class. It can be 
   achived by Interfaces.
5. C++ supports operator overloading but Java doesn't.
6. C++ supports Pointers , you can write Pointers program in C++ but in Java you cannot write Pointers programm
    in java but java supports Pointers internally for memory management.
7. C++ used only compiler. C++ programm converted source code to byte code through compiler directly, thats why C++ is
    platform dependent but in case of java , java source code first converted into byte code due to compilation time
    then this code is executed by interpreter line by line with the help of JVM. Due to this facility Java is
    platform independent.
8. C++ supports call by value and call by refrence both but java supports only call by value.
9. C++ supports structures and union both but Java doesn't supports.
10. C++ does not have own thread it is access by third party libraries but java has built in threads.
11. C++ supports Virtual keyword so that we can decide wether or not override a function but in case of Java,
    Java does not support Virtual keyword we can override always not static methods. 
12. C++ is less secure because of pointers but java is more secure because it does not have pointers.
13. C++ is more faseter than Java due to direct comiplation.

            ******************FEATURES OF JAVA************************
        
The primary goal of creating Java programming language was to make a language that will be simple, secure and portable. 

1. Simple  2. Portable  3. Secure  4. High Performance  5. Object Oriented 
 6. Robust  7. Interpreted  8. Dynamic  9. Multithreaded  10. Platform independent 

            *****************BASIC PROGRAM OF JAVA ***********************

public class index{
    public static void main(String args[]){
        System.our.println("Hello World");
    }
}

Public -> It is an access modifier that means it is accessble for all.
Class -> For declaration of a class
Static -> It is a keyword . Method that we declare static called static method. In java we declare main method as a static method 
          because there will not need to create object of this class . It saves memory .
Void -> It is a return type . It means it will not return any value.
Main() -> Is is a starting point of every Java program.
String[] args -> String[] args allows you to receive input from the command line when your Java program starts.
System.out.println() -> It is used to print statement on the console . Where System is class , out is an object of Printstream class 
                         and println is a method of Printstream class.

             ******************JDK JRE JVM****************************

JVM -> JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine . It provides runtime environment for execution of java program. In JVM has interpreter 
       that interpreted java bytecode line by line thats why java is platform independent because of this JVM. 

JRE -> Java Runtime Environment is a set of software tools that are used for developing Java applications. It is used to provide 
        run time environments.

JDK -> Java Development Kit is a software development environment that is used to develop java applications.


                 ***********************VARIABLES IN JAVA************************

Variable -> A variable is a container which store the value and data of program . It has a specific data type.

1. Local 
2. Instance 
3. Static

1. Local -> Variable which declares inside the body of the method is called Local variable. We can use these variables only
            inside the methods. It cannot be define as static variable.
2. Instance -> Variable which declares inside the class but outside the method is called instance variable. 
3. Static -> A variable that declares with static keyword is called static variable. It cannot be local. we can create a single copy of 
             the static variable and share among all the instances of the class. Memory allocation for Static  variables only once
             when the class is loaded.


            ******************* DATA TYPES IN JAVA ********************************

Java is a statically type programming language because we have to declare the variable type and name before their use.
DATA TYPE -> Data type specify which type of data we can store in the variable. 

                               TYPES
                            
       PRIMITIVES                                NON - PRIMITIVES
       1. BYTE                                   1. CLASSES
       2. SHORT                                  2. STRINGS
       3. INT                                    3. INTERFACES
       4. LONG                                   4. ARRAYS
       5. FLOAT
       6. DOUBLE
       7. BOOLEAN
       8. CHAR

1. Boolean -> Size 1 bytes (8 bits) . Default value False.
2. Byte -> 1 byte (8 bits ) Range (-128 to 127) . default value 0
3. Short -> 2 byte (16 bits) Range (-32,768 to 32,767) . default value 0
4. Int -> 4 byte (32 bits) Range (-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647). default value 0
5. Long -> 8 byte (64 bits) Range (- 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to  9,223,372,036,854,775,807) . Its default value is 0.0L or 0.0l.
6. Float -> 4 byte (32 bits) Its default value is 0.0f or 0.0F.
7. Double -> 8 byte (64 bits) Its default value is 0.0.
8. Char -> 2 byte (16-bits)


             *********************** OPERATORS IN JAVA *******************

1. Arithmetic ->   + - * / %
2. Unary -> Unary Plus (+), Unary Minus (-), ++, --, !(It is used to convert boolean value)
3. Relational / Conditional -> <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=
4. Assignment -> =, +=, *=, /=, %=
5. Shift -> Left Shift (<<), Right Shift (>>)
6. Bitwise -> |, &, ^, ~
7. Ternary -> Ex. (a<b)?a:b; 
8. Logical -> &&, ||, !

             ************************ CONTROL STATEMENTS ******************
        
1. if-else
2. switch 
3. for loop
4. for each
5. while
6. do while
7. break
8. continue 
9. comments


            ************************* WAYS OF TAKING USER INPUTS *******************

1. Scanner Class
2. BufferedReader
3. console
4. Command Line Arguments
5. JOption Pane -> It shows an input pannel on the screen

           *************************** Method **************************

Method is the block of code that perform a specific task. Method describes the behaviour of a class.
Breaking code into separate methods helps improve readability, reusability, and maintainability

Real life example of method :- In a car there are various facilities like break ac and many more the are the methods of car.

Method is the actual behaviour of a class.


           ************************** OOPS CONCEPTS ********************************

Object Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm where everything is treated as an object. 
Object Oriented Programming paradigm provides such as inheritance , data binding and ploymorphism . 
Java is a fully Object Oriented Programming language except PRIMITIVE types because Java has 8 primitive data types and these are not 
objects . These are directly handeled by JVM . 
They are : byte, short, int, long, double, float, boolean, char.

Object Oriented Programming aims to implement a real world entity like objects, classes, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism.
Benifits of OOPS -> Code modularity, reusability, maintanability.

 PILLERS OF OOPS-> 
                  1. Object
                  2. Class
                  3. Inheritance
                  4. Polymorphism
                  5. Encapsulation
                  6. Abstraction
 
 Apart from these concepts OOPS has another terms -> Coupling, Cohesion, Association, Aggregation, Composition

                        ********************* Object ******************

1. OBJECT -> Object know what it can do is called its property and what a object do is its behaviour. An Object is a template of a 
class it describes what a class can do.

        Properties of object - it describes the data of a object;
        behaviour of object - it describes what object is doing.



2.                     ************************* Class ************************

CLASS -> Class is the collection of data member and member function.

In object-oriented programming, a class is a basic building block. It can be defined as template that describes the data and behaviour 
associated with the class instantiation. Instantiating a class is to create an object (variable) of that class that can be used to access 
the member variables and methods of the class.

3 .                     ********************** Constructor ******************                           (26/09/2025)

Constructor is special type of member function OR method. It has same as class name ans it dosent return any value. Just specify the access type of it. Constructor is called when we created a new object.

Every time when we create an object by using the new keyword, it calls a default constructor. If there is no constructor available in the class. In such case, Java compiler provides a default constructor by default.

Constructor are oftenly used to initlize the undefined values in class.

TYPES OF CONSTRUCTOR :-

                1 Compiler Defined :- It is creted by compiler itself when there are not any constructor present in a class.

                2 Parametrize 
                            |---> Default :- It is created by programer it does not take any Arguments.
                                  Use :- Ensuring Default Initialization (When we need to assign default value to a variable)
                                        // It is basically provided to modify the default constructor //

                            |---> Parametrize :- In this constructor we pass the Arguments. We can create different Parametrize constructor according to the use;
                                  Use :- Basically it is used to initilize the instance variable

* When we have more than one user defined constructor in our class with different parameter (in nuber or in type) is called constructor overloading.
        

                    ******************* Static keyword *******************                                             (30/09/2025)

Static keyword in java is non access access modifier. It is used for memory management.The static keyword belongs to class rather than object variable. Static content gets load in the memory when the class get loads in the memory. JVM has different place to store static content.All object share the same memory to static content.

    Characterstics :-

        Belongs to the Class, Not the Object :- 
        Anything marked as static is tied to the class itself, not individual objects. It means all objects share the same static variables and methods.

        Access Without an Object :- 
        Since static members belong to the class, you can access them directly using the class name. No need to create an object.

        Static Methods Cannot Use Instance Variables Directly :- 
        A static method does not know about specific objects, so it cannot directly access non-static (instance) variables or methods.

        Main Method is Static :- 
        The main method in Java is static so that Java can run the program without creating an object first.

        Executed Once When the Class is Loaded :-
        A static block runs once when the class is first loaded, making it useful for initializing things like constants.

        Not Overridden Like Normal Methods :- 
        Static methods do not follow typical method overriding. If a subclass defines the same static method, it's more like re-declaring it rather than overriding it.

    Static Keyword can be used with :
                                    |---->variable
                                    |---->method
                                    |---->block
                                    |---->nested class

    Static variable :- Static variable share same memory among all object. It loads when the class gets load in memory.
                       It is called as class variable instead of objectvariable. 
                       We can call the static variable with class name (ClassName.VARNAME) and this is best way to call it. 
                       If we change the value of static variable for one object it will get change for all objects. 

    Basically it is used to make constant.


    Static Method :- A static method can call without creating an instance of class.
                     Static method is known as class method instead of object method.
                     A static method cannot directly not-static content.
                     This and super keyword cannot use static method.

                     If we want of use the non static variable in static method then we have to pass the the object to static method


                     Ex :- 

                        import java.util.*;
                        class newclass{
                            static String name;
                            static int pr;
                            static int nm;
                            int dm ;
                            static void display1(newclass n123){
                                System.out.println(name+" "+pr+" "+nm+" "+n123.dm);
                            }
                            void display(){
                                System.out.println("name "+name+" price "+pr+" number "+nm);
                            }
                        }
                        public class dsa {
                            public static void main(String[] args) {
                                newclass.name="apple";
                                newclass.pr=12334598;
                                newclass.nm=127329; 
                                newclass n12 = new newclass();
                                n12.dm= 123;
                                newclass.display1(n12);
                            }
                        }                     


    Static block :- A static block in Java is a special block of code marked with the static keyword, also known as a static initializer block. 
                    It is primarily used for initializing static variables or performing other setup operations that need to occur once when the class is 
                    loaded into memory

                    Static blocks are executed only once when the class is loaded into memory, before the execution of the main method or the creation of any object of the class.

                    They are ideal for complex static variable initialization that cannot be done in a single statement, loading configuration files, setting up static resources, or establishing initial connections.



    *** Class.forname Method is used to load your class in memory. Syntsx :- Class.forname("CLASSNAME"); 

                    *********************** This Keyword ************************                         (08 / 10 /2025)

The this keyword in Java is a reference to the current object within a class.
this keyword refers to the current object of a class.
Mostly this keyword is used to eliminate the ambiguity between local variable ans global variable.
 USES :- 

    1. Differentiating between instance variables and local variables/parameters:-
        When a method or constructor parameter has the same name as an instance variable, this is used to explicitly refer to the instance variable, preventing ambiguity. 

    2. Calls Other Methods in the Same Class:-
        We don't always need this, but we can use it explicitly to call another method within the same class.
        * In java compiler automatic add this keyword when we call method of same class.
    
    3. Supports Constructor Chaining:-
        this() can be used inside a constructor to call another constructor in the same class, helping reuse code.

    4. this: To Pass as an Argument in The Method:-
        Java this keyword can also be passed as an argument in the method. It is mainly used in event handling. Let's see the example.

    5) this: To Pass as Argument in The Constructor Call:-
        We can pass the this keyword in the constructor also. It is useful if we have to use one object in multiple classes. Let's see the example:
            class B{    
                A4 obj;    
                B(A4 obj){    
                    this.obj=obj;    
                }    
                void display(){    
                    System.out.println(obj.data);//using data member of A4 class    
                }    
            }    
            class Main {    
                int data=10;    
                A4(){    
                   B b=new B(this);    
                   b.display();    
                }    
                public static void main(String args[]){    
                   A4 a=new A4();    
                }    
            }   


    Advantages :- 

        Avoids Confusion: If a method has a parameter with the same name as an instance variable, it helps refer to the instance variable.

        Improves Readability: It makes it clear that you're working with the object's own data.
        
        Simplifies Constructor Chaining: It allows one constructor to call another, reducing duplicate code.

        Enables Method Chaining: We can call multiple methods in one statement, making the code cleaner.

        Passes the Object Itself: Sometimes, you need to send the current object to another method, and this makes it easy.
