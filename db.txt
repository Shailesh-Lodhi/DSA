Database -> A database is a shared collection of logical related data and description of these data desgine to meet the information need to an organization.

IMPORTANCE OF DATABASE
1. Data storage -> A database is used to store large amount of structure data making it easily, accessible, searchable and retrivable.
2. Data analysis -> A database can be used to perform complex data analysis generate reports and provide insights into the data.
3. Records Copying -> A database is often used to keep track of important records such as financial transaction , customer information.
4. Web applications -> 



TYPES OF DATABASES

1. Relational db -> Also known as sql database . this database use a relational model to organize data into tables with rows and columns .
ex. -> sql, oracle, microsoft asscrss, excel, access.
2. No sql database - > These database are designed to handle large amount of unstructured or semi structured data such as 
documnets file, images, audio or videos. 
ex. -> mongo db.
3. Column db -> THese db store data in columns rather than rows .
ex. -> amazon red shift
4. Graph -> These db are used to store and query graph structured data such as social networks connections or recomandations system.
ex.-> Amazon neptuen.
5. Key value db-> these db store data as a collection of key name and key values.
ex-> amazon dynamo db

Relational database -> 
 id    st_name    st_course     st_fees
 1     Ram         Java         10000
 2     A           C            20000
 3     B           C++          Null
 4     C           Py           15000

Column -> Attributes, Field.
Rows -> Tupple , records.
No. of columns -> set of columns
No. of rows -> set of rows.

DBMS -> A dbms is a software system that provides the interfaces and tools needed to store , organize and manage data in a database or DBMS act 
as a intermediate between the database and the applications or users that access the data stored in the database.

                                                             Keys  

A key in a database is attribute or a set of attribute that uniquely indentify a row(touple) in a table.

Types of key -> 
    super  , 
    candidate ,
    *primary ,
    alternate, 
    composite, 
    surrogate,  
    *forign .

    1. Super Keys - It is a set of comnbination of all attribute.
                                    
    2. Candidate key - It is a minimal super key .

    3. *Primary key - Primary key is used to uniquely identify the table or it doesnt have any duplicate value and blank space and try that it has less length and it should numiric.

    4. Alternate key - It could be a primary key. OR Alternate Key is any candidate key not selected as the primary key.

    5. Composite key - A composite key is a primary key that is made up of more than one column to uniquely identify records in a table.

    6. Surrogate key - When we do not have a natural primary key in a table, then we need to artificially create one in order to uniquely identify a row in the table, this key is called surrogate key.

    7. *Forign key - A foreign key is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table. OR

        3) drop :- This command id used to  delete database and table object.
        4) truncate :- This command iis used to delete all the rows from the table.


    b) DML (Data Manipulation Language) :- Data Manipulation Language consists all the commands to manipulate the data in a table.
        1) insert :- This command is used to add row in a table OR create new row in a table.

        2) revoke :- This command withdraw access rights (permissions) on database.


    d) TCL (Transaction Control Language) :- Transaction Control Language is ussed to manage all the Transaction changes made by DML.
        1)commit :- Save database changes and end Transaction.
        2) rollback :- Undo all changes that are not commit and end Transaction.



                                                            Cardinality

Cardinality in database relationship refers to the number of occerence of an entity in a relationship with another entity.
    1) One to One           2) One to Many          3) Many to One          4)Many to Many

    1)One to One :- In this entity of set A is connected to atleast one entity of set B.  OR    One row of table A is connected to atleast one row of another table.

    2)One to Many :- In this entity of set A is connected to multiple entity of set B. 

    3)Many to One :- In this multiple entity of set A is connected to one entity of set B.

    4)Many to Many :- In this multiple entity of set A is connected to multiple entity of set B.

                                                            SQl Code

                                    SELECT * FROM mobile_info.sm;
                                    select * from sm where price>50000 and brand_name like 'a%' and brand_name like '%e';
                                    select * from sm order by brand_name asc;
                                    select * from sm order by brand_name desc;
                                    select * from sm where price>50000 order by brand_name asc;
                                    select * from sm limit 1;
                                    select * from sm order by price desc limit 5;
                                    select * from sm order by price asc limit 10;
                                    select * from sm order by price desc limit 1,1;
                                    select * from sm order by price desc limit 4,1;
                                    select * from sm order by price desc limit 2,2;
                                    select * from sm where brand_name="apple" and price<50000 order by price asc limit 1;


                                    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Like Operator :- The LIKE operator in SQL is used in the WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

    Ex :- select * from smartphones where brand_name like 'a%';  // give all smartphones whose brand_name which starts with a;

          select * from smartphones where brand_name like '%e'; // give all  smartphones whose brand_name which ends with e;

          select * from smartphones where brand_name like ''%p%'; // give all smartphones which contain p in its brand_name at any position.

          
                                    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Order By :- It is used to sort the result set in ascending or descending order by one or more columns.By default it always sort in assending order;

    Ex :- select * from smartphones order by price asc; 
          select * from smartphones order by brand_name asc; // it sort the result in assending order.

          select * from smartphones order by price desc;
          select * from smartphones order by brand_name desc; // it sort th result in decending order.


                                    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*Limit Function :- The LIMIT Function in SQL is used to restrict the number of rows returned by a query. It is particularly useful when you need to fetch a subset of   data.

        Types of limit Function :- limit x; // it gives only number of rows which we give on the place of x ;

                                   Ex :- select * from smartphones limit 1; 
                                         select * from smartphones order by price desc limit 5;
                                         select * from smartphones order by price asc limit 10;

                                   limit x, y; // on the place of x we give number of row which we want to skip && on the place of we give number of rows which we want after skip.  

                                   Ex :- select * from smartphones order by price asc limit 10;
                                         select * from smartphones order by price desc limit 1,1;
                                         select * from smartphones order by price desc limit 4,1;
                                         select * from smartphones order by price desc limit 2,2;
